# Project1
First project a Career Portfolio it's a bit bare right now, but I am excited to see the full potential this will become with time.

This site was created with mainly HTML, but with the help of CSS and JS as well. 

A few links on some of the help I searched for:

Responsive Navbar Youtube video: FLEXBOX Responsive Navbar (with Logo) | Navigation Menu Bar with HTML, CSS & JavaScript
This video really helped break down what I was doing wrong with my nav bar after many trial and error.

W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/
This website helped tremendously with any forgotten material or how something in either HTML, CSS, or JS worked.

Marquee: https://www.w3schools.in/html/marquee-tag#:~:text=Marquee%20speed%20can%20be%20changed,scrolling%20speed%20will%20also%20increase.&text=Marquee%20can%20also%20be%20implemented%20using%20CSS.
This link to W3Schools really help my page come to live and explained how it was needed to be inserted into my code.

JS Anchor Links Youtube video: JavaScript - How to Add Smooth Scrolling Anchor Links to Jump to a Specific Part of a Web Page
This video explained with great detail how to click and scroll to a specific part of my page. Itâ€™s a great video that helped so much!

A part of this project that really got me excited was using icons that have a link and properly direct you to the link.
